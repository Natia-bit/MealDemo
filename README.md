# MealDemo
Demo for meal planner

[First Project]
Problem: planning meals every week can be frustrating and you can't remember all the recipes. 
Trying to balance different types of food adds to the complexity. Eventually you end up making the same thing over and over again. 

The purpose of the application is to plan the weekly meal based on set requirements: 
- Alternate between different types of meals throughout the week, such as vegetable, chicken, beef, pork, fish, soups, small snacks, and salads  
- Provide variety and not repeat the same meals each week
